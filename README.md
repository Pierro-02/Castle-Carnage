# Castle Carnage

### Summary
Castle Carnage is a tower defense mobile game, where the player plans out the enemy route and tower placement before the enemy swarm attacks. 

This game is currently under development by the team *Ascended Gamers* for the month long **Rookie Game Jam** by **Mindstorm Studios** in Pakistan.

### Game Ideation
Castle Carnage takes the basic concepts of Tower Defense games and adds a new twist to it, where players also have to prepare the path for the enemies to reach the castle. In doing so they will have to manage their resources to come up with an efficient route to save their cash for the towers but also create a good enough route through the towers as to not let the enemies reach thier base. It is the perfect combination between managing resources and classical tower defense. 

The theme for the Game Jam was "Tower Defense" and the game was supposed to be a "Hyper Casual Mobile Game", which is prospected to be the most successful game industry in the coming years. To align with the HCG restriction, Castle Carnage uses a level system and Main Menu Upgrades for towers. 

### The Team
Although the complete team is made of 3rd year BS-Cs students from FAST NUCES-ISB, some of us decided it was better to take on tasks that they have never done and leave it on pure chance that the game becomes a success. You can be the judge for who those ppl are.
